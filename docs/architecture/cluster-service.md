# Cluster Service

This document describes how `ClusterService` coordinates multiple Flight server nodes: registration, heartbeat, file inventory, load tracking, and statement cache lifecycle.

## Overview

`ClusterService` runs on every Flight server node. It uses Hazelcast distributed maps to share state across the cluster. Each node registers itself, publishes its file inventory, and maintains a heartbeat. The service is used during query planning to discover live nodes, locate files, and balance load.

## Components

`ClusterService` wraps a `HazelcastAdapter` instance. Hazelcast provides four distributed maps used by the service:

| Map              | Key                    | Value                | Purpose                                 |
|------------------|------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `serverRegistry` | `flight-server-N:32010`| `Long` (load bytes)  | Node registration + current load        |
| `serverHeartbeats`| `flight-server-N:32010`| `Long` (timestamp)   | Heartbeat timestamps for liveness check |
| `serverFiles`    | `flight-server-N:32010`| `Map<String, Long>`  | Per-node file inventory (path -> bytes) |
| `statementCache` | handle (UUID string)   | `HandleState`        | Query state, TTL 10 minutes             |

## Server Registration and Deregistration

### Startup

When a Flight server starts, its `ClusterService` constructor:

```java
hazelcast.serverRegistry().put(serverUri, 0L);
hazelcast.serverHeartbeats().put(serverUri, System.currentTimeMillis());
```

The node writes its URI (e.g. `flight-server-1:32010`) into both maps with an initial load of 0.

### Shutdown

`ClusterService.close()` removes the node from both maps:

```java
hazelcast.serverRegistry().remove(serverUri);
hazelcast.serverHeartbeats().remove(serverUri);
```

This prevents stale entries when a node shuts down gracefully.

## Heartbeat Mechanism

After registration, a scheduled executor sends heartbeats every 15 seconds:

```java
heartbeatExecutor.scheduleAtFixedRate(() -> {
    hazelcast.serverRegistry().putIfAbsent(serverUri, 0L);
    hazelcast.serverHeartbeats().put(serverUri, System.currentTimeMillis());
}, 15, 15, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```

The executor is a single daemon thread named `flight-heartbeat`. Each heartbeat writes the current timestamp into `serverHeartbeats`.

### Liveness Check

Before planning a query, `FlightSqlProducer` calls `ClusterService.filterLiveServers()`. This method reads all heartbeats, filters out nodes whose last heartbeat is older than 45 seconds, and removes dead nodes from both maps:

```java
long deadline = now - 45_000; // 45 seconds without heartbeat = dead
for (String uri : serverUris) {
    Long lastHb = heartbeats.get(uri);
    if (lastHb == null) {
        // Newly registered node, no heartbeat yet — treat as alive
        live.add(uri);
    } else if (lastHb >= deadline) {
        live.add(uri);
    } else {
        // Stale — remove from cluster
        hazelcast.serverRegistry().remove(uri);
        hazelcast.serverHeartbeats().remove(uri);
    }
}
```

A node that has no heartbeat entry yet (registered but heartbeat hasn't fired) is treated as alive. This handles the short window between registration and the first heartbeat.

Time constants:

| Parameter            | Value   | Purpose                       |
|----------------------|---------|-------------------------------|
| `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SEC` | 15s | How often each node writes its heartbeat |
| `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_SEC`  | 45s | How long without heartbeat before a node is considered dead |

### Server Loads

Load is tracked as a single `Long` value per server in `serverRegistry`. Initially 0, it increases when a query handle is created (the `bytes` value from `HandleState`) and decreases when a handle expires or is explicitly removed.

`ClusterService.addLoad(uri, delta)` adds a signed delta to a server's load:

```java
hazelcast.serverRegistry().compute(uri, (k, v) -> {
    if (v == null) return delta;
    long updated = v + delta;
    return updated <= 0 ? 0L : updated;
});
```

Two methods expose load data:
- `allServerLoads()` — returns loads for all registered servers
- `getLoads(serverUris)` — returns loads for a specific set of servers

## File Inventory

After startup, each Flight server scans its data directory and calls `registerLocalFiles()`:

```java
hazelcast.serverFiles().put(this.serverUri, new LinkedHashMap<>(files));
```

Files are stored as relative paths with their byte sizes. This creates a distributed inventory across all nodes.

### File Location Resolution

When planning a query, `FlightSqlProducer` calls `fileLocations()` to build a complete picture of where every Parquet file lives:

```java
public Map<String, FileAssignment> fileLocations() {
    Map<String, Map<String, Long>> inventories = new LinkedHashMap<>();
    for (Map.Entry<String, Map<String, Long>> entry : hazelcast.serverFiles().entrySet()) {
        inventories.put(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue());
    }
    Map<String, FileAssignment> result = new LinkedHashMap<>();
    for (Map.Entry<String, Map<String, Long>> server : inventories.entrySet()) {
        String serverUri = server.getKey();
        for (Map.Entry<String, Long> file : server.getValue().entrySet()) {
            result.compute(file.getKey(), (path, current) -> {
                Set<String> owners = new LinkedHashSet<>();
                long size = file.getValue();
                if (current != null) {
                    if (current.size() != size) {
                        throw new IllegalStateException(
                            "Conflicting sizes for replicated file " + path);
                    }
                    owners.addAll(current.hosts());
                }
                owners.add(serverUri);
                return new FileAssignment(size, owners);
            });
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

The result is a map of `relative_path -> FileAssignment(size, [host1, host2, ...])`. If the same file appears on multiple nodes, it is treated as a replica — both hosts are preserved. `FileAssignment` throws if replicas report different sizes.

`hasFileInventory(serverUri)` checks whether a specific node has published its inventory.

## Statement Cache and Handle Lifecycle

### Handle Storage

During `GetFlightInfo`, the server creates a handle (UUID) and stores the query state in `statementCache` with a 10-minute TTL:

```java
hazelcast.statementCache().put(handle, state, 10, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
```

Each endpoint also gets its own handle pointing to the subset of files assigned to that node.

### Handle Retrieval

During `DoGet`, the server extracts the handle from the ticket and loads state from any node's local Hazelcast:

```java
HandleState state = (HandleState) hazelcast.statementCache().get(handle);
```

This works because `statementCache` is a distributed map — a ticket created by node A can be resolved by node B.

### Handle Removal

When query execution completes, the server explicitly removes the handle:

```java
hazelcast.statementCache().remove(handle);
```

### Handle Expiry

If a handle is not explicitly removed (e.g. client disconnected, network failure, crash), Hazelcast evicts it after 10 minutes. The eviction triggers an `EntryExpiredListener` registered in `ClusterService`:

```java
hazelcast.onStatementExpired((EntryExpiredListener<String, Serializable>) event -> {
    Serializable value = event.getOldValue();
    if (value instanceof HandleState state && state.serverUri() != null) {
        hazelcast.serverRegistry().compute(state.serverUri(), (k, v) -> {
            if (v == null) return null;
            long updated = v - state.bytes();
            return updated <= 0 ? 0L : updated;
        });
    }
});
```

When a handle expires, its `bytes` value is subtracted from the owning server's load. This prevents load leaks from abandoned connections. If the server has already been removed from the registry, the computation exits early.

## Interaction with Query Execution

During `GetFlightInfo`:

1. `FlightSqlProducer` calls `filterLiveServers()` to get active nodes.
2. `ParquetAdapter.locationsForQuery()` determines which files belong to the query.
3. `ClusterService.fileLocations()` provides the distributed file inventory.
4. `QueryPlanner.pickServer()` selects the best node for each file, preferring nodes that host the file's blocks and picking the one with the lowest load among candidates.
5. A handle is stored in `statementCache` with a 10-minute TTL.
6. Each endpoint stores its own handle with the assigned file list.

During `DoGet`:

1. The handle is loaded from `statementCache`.
2. The assigned files and SQL query are retrieved.
3. `ExecutionService` reads and streams the result.
4. On completion, `removeHandle()` is called.

If `DoGet` never arrives (client abandons the query after `GetFlightInfo`), the handle expires naturally after 10 minutes, and the load is corrected by the expiry listener.
